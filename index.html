          <h2>Hi! My name is Yuri Liang</h2>
          <p>I'm a software engineer living in San Antonio, Texas</p>
          <p>As a former Mandarin Chinese teacher, I enjoy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>thinking about the solutions I could have had when I was teaching online</li>
            <li>sharing new technical solutions with my teacher friends</li>
            <li>growing together with my community, and voyaging in this digital era</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please feel free take a look around my website, and contact me should you have any questions.</p>

          <h2>About Yuri</h2>
          <p>I'm originally from Tianjin, China. I came to states to pursue my MA in 2014.</p>
          <p>I enjoyed my time at Oklahoma City University, then moved to Virginia to start my teaching career in 2016.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to 2020, I realized that I really enjoy my time with technology, and would love to explore more behind the scene.</p>
          <p>As a student at Thinkful, I couldn't be happier. I can feel my heart racing whenever I think about my future as a software engineer.</p>
          <p>I trust my coding experience, work ethic and enthusiasm will well transfer into whatever the challenge you give to me.</p>
