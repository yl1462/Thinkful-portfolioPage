          <h2>Hi! My name is Yuri Liang</h2>
          <p>I'm a software engineer living in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
          <p>As a former Mandarin Chinese teacher, I enjoy:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>thinking about the solutions I could have had when I was teaching online</li>
            <li>sharing new technical solutions with my teacher friends</li>
            <li>growing together with my community, and voyaging in this digital era</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please feel free take a look around my website, and contact me should you have any questions.</p>

          <h2>About Yuri</h2>
          <p>I've been working as a teacher my whole life. As much as I enjoyed it, I want to change it. Improve how people learn through technology.</p>
          <p>I've always enjoyed utlizing technology in my classroom and daily life, for its efficiency and conveniency. I love cooking, with the help of online cooking guide, it's like the chef is there to help me step by step. I also spend a lot of time on reading, carrying my tablet with me everywhere is much easier than the entire libary at home.</p>
          <p>Now, as a student at Thinkful, I couldn't be happier and motivated to explore behind the "scence". I can feel my heart beat racing whenever I think about working as a software engineer in the future.</p>
          <p>I trust my coding experience, work ethic and enthusiasm will well transfer into whatever the challenge you give to me.</p>
